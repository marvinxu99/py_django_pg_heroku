We usually have quite a few project-specific apps per project here, 
and to try and keep dependencies reasonably clean we usually have two more apps:

- "core" in which we put things shared by other apps (any app can depend on "core",   
  "core" doesn't depend on any app),

- and "main" in which tie things together ("main" can depend on any app, 
  no app is allowed to depend on "main").
